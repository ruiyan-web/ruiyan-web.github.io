== About me
Welcome to my personal website. I am an associate professor in the [https://iai.buaa.edu.cn/index.htm School of Artificial Intelligence] at [https://www.buaa.edu.cn Beihang University]. Before joining Beihang University, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ Department of Computer Science] at [[https://www.ox.ac.uk/ University of Oxford], working with [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/marta.kwiatkowska/  Prof. Marta Kwiatkowska] from Mar. 2021 to Jun. 2024. I obtained my PhD degree in the Department of Automation at [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Tsinghua University] in Jan. 2021. My PhD advisor was Prof. Yisheng Zhong. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Automation from Beihang University in 2015. I was a visiting scholar with the
Department of Mechanical Engineering at University of California, Santa Barbara from Feb. 2019 to Feb. 2020, supervised by [http://motion.me.ucsb.edu Prof. Francesco Bullo]. My current research focuses on differential games, neuro-symbolic stochastic games and multi-agent reinforcement learning. The applications include neural-symbolic systems, and multi-uav/robot cooperation and competition.
