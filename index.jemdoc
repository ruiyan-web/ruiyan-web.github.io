== About me
Welcome to my personal website. I am a postdoctoral fellow (research associate) in the [https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/ Department of Computer Science] at [[https://www.ox.ac.uk/ University of Oxford], working with [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/marta.kwiatkowska/  Prof. Marta Kwiatkowska]. Before joining University of Oxford, I obtained my PhD degree in the Department of Automation at [https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/ Tsinghua University] in Jan. 2021. My PhD advisor was Prof. Yisheng Zhong. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Automation from Beihang University in 2015. I was a visiting scholar with the
Mechanical Engineering Department and the Center for Control, Dynamical Systems and Computation at the University of California, Santa Barbara from Feb 2019 to Feb 2020, supervised by [http://motion.me.ucsb.edu Prof. Francesco Bullo]. My current research focuses on game theory, probabilistic verification and synthesis, reach-avoid differential games and multi-agent reinforcement learning. The applications include neural-symbolic systems, multi-robot cooperation and competition, and multi-vehicle automated driving.
